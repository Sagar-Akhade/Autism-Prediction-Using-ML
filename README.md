# What is AUTISM ??

### Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a developmental disorder that affects communication, social interaction, behavior, and interests. It's called a "spectrum" disorder because individuals with autism can have a wide range of symptoms and levels of impairment. 

### Some common characteristics of autism include challenges in social interaction, difficulty with verbal and nonverbal communication, repetitive behaviors, and highly focused interests. However, the severity and combination of these traits can vary greatly among individuals.

### Autism typically appears in early childhood and lasts throughout a person's life. While the exact cause of autism is not known, it's believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no known cure for autism, but early intervention and various therapies can help individuals improve their skills and quality of life.
